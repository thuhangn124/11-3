# 11-3As more non-essential businesses except for bars, discos, and karaoke shops are allowed to reopen at full capacity in Ho Chi Minh City from Tuesday, the owners make sure that COVID-19 prevention and control measures are strictly applied.

Due to the complicated developments of the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities in the city previously required all beauty salons, karaoke shops, discos, pubs, bars, clubs, beer clubs, massage parlors, saunas, online game centers, wedding reception centers, caf√©s, theaters, cinemas, gyms, and other sports facilities to cease operations on February 9.

Ho Chi Minh City has not recorded any community transmission since February 11, after Vietnam was hit by a new wave of local infections on March 27.

The city confirmed 36 domestic COVID-19 cases between February 6 and 11.

From March 1, non-essential services and businesses were allowed to reopen, but discos, bars, karaoke parlors, pubs, clubs, beer clubs, and sports facilities in an enclosed space remained shuttered.

In the latest decision that took effect from Tuesday, only bars, discos, and karaoke shops keep suspended.

Welcoming customers back after the month-long suspension, the permitted non-essential businesses can operate at full capacity.

Maintaining vigilance against the virus, they also stick to safety measures recommended by the Ministry of Health.
